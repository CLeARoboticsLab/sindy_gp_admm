# GaussianSINDy

Discovering Equations of Motion from Data 

## Research Notes 

### June 19, 2023 
- put predator_prey plot into function in utils.jl 
- added metrics to end of predator_prey_test.jl (just opnorm) for truth vs. sindy vs. gpsindy 
- also tried just turning off one small coefficient for sindy per David's suggestion - it makes trajectory propagate much differently 
- now just put everything that you've found into a latex document ... and run more experiments
