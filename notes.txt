# Last week (July 17-21): 

- look into sparsity: increase lambda, compare gpsindy and sindy 
- decrease samples and increase noise, gpsindy works better? 
- use GP to smooth data and use as input into sindy 

fixed kernel?  
- input should be time, not x or dx as previously specified in the paper? 


# This week (July 24-28): 

Somi: (2)  
- try Matern52 kernel within SINDy-GP-ADMM (and maybe Matern32 kernel) 

David: (4) 
- table it for now: figure right way to do sparsity, soft thresholding? hard thresholding?
- iterate: GP --> SINDy --> GP --> SINDy --> repeat  
    - GP takes in (t,x) as input, outputs smoothed x 
    - Coefficients * function library to generate dx ? 
- (tangential) try SINDy with soft thresholding 
- create pull request, merge into main 

Adam: (1) --> GPs 
- standardize x, add noise --> GP --> derivative of GP 
- set up kernel to be function of x 

Yue: (3) --> l1 norm min, ADMM 
- remove relative tolerances for ADMM 
- SINDy, keep it the way it is  
- don't change hyperparameters every step for ADMM (do not change objective function at every iteration), maybe let ADMM run for 1000 iterations and then update hyperparameters 

Junette: 
- just do Jake's car data 

# July 26 

Somi: 
1. smooth dx_noise with x_noise as training inputs --> dx_GP
    - try diff kernel? SE 
    - set up kernel to be function of x 
2. plug in dx_GP and x_noise into SINDy, good plots? 
3. fix ADMM stuff, only update hyperparameters at the start 
4. compare SINDy and GPSINDy
